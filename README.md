# 🚀 Golang Project Starter Kit

This is the Golang Project Starter Kit! 🎉 This a simple repository that contains starter code for a Golang project, following a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. It simplifies the process of setting up a new project from scratch, allowing you to focus on building your application's core functionality.

In this setup, we use the `User` entity as an example, but you can easily replicate and add new entities as required for your specific project needs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThembinkosiThemba/go-project-starter.git
cd golang-project-starter
```

2. Install dependencies and run the roject:

```bash
go mod tidy
make run
```

If you don't have `Make` installed, you can run

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

3. Set up your environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your variables)

## 🏗️ Project Setup

## 💾 Database Setup

Depending on which database you are going to be using, make sure you update the `main.go` initialization lines so it works perfectly for your choice. By default, this project uses `Mongo DB` and this code is as follows:
```golang
userRepo, err := config.InitializeRepositoriesMongo()
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

userUsecase := config.InitializeUsecasesMongo(userRepo)
```

Notice we are using these two mongo functions which are `InitializeRepositoriesMongo` and `InitializeUsecasesMongo`

If for example you want to use Postgres, you will update these functions and use `InitializeRepositoriesPostgres` and `InitializeUsecasesPostgres`:
```golang
userRepo, err := config.InitializeRepositoriesPostgres()
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}

userUsecase := config.InitializeUsecasesPostgres(userRepo)

```
### MongoDB

1. Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running. Alternatively, you can use [Mongo DB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register), create a project, and get the connection string.
2. Update the MongoDB connection string in your `.env` file

### PostgreSQL

1. Install PostgreSQL if you haven't already.
2. Create a new database for your project.
3. Update the PostgreSQL connection details in your `.env` file
4. The migrations will automatically run when you run the project.

Alternatively, you can use solutions like [Aiven](https://aiven.io/) which has completely hosted db solutions. Think of it as Atlas, and it's completely free.

### Docker setup

Open the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and rename make changes to the following line (`/go-project-starter`) to reflect the name of the project you are building.

```Dockerfile
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o /go-project-starter ./cmd/main.go

and

CMD [ "/go-project-starter" ]
```

If you are building say `social-media-app`, then you should have:

```Dockerfile
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o /social-media-app ./cmd/main.go

and

CMD [ "social-media-app" ]
```

### Mixpanel

This project also has support for event tracking using Mixpanel. Login to [Mixpanel](mixpanel.com) and create a project, get the project id in the settings and update your env file as well.

### Logger
This projects now supports a custom logger. Features include:
- saving logs to files (errors, warnings and infos). These logs can be stored in their separate files. Check `/logs` folder once you use any of the logs.
- print's out logs in the terminal


## 🛠️ Customization

To add a new entity:

1. Create a new file in `internal/entity` for your entity
2. Implement repository interfaces in `internal/repository` and choose either database.
3. Create use cases in `internal/application/usecase`
4. Add HTTP handlers in `internal/routes/handler`
5. Update routes in `internal/routes/handler/routes.go`
